# Event Planner

The Event Planner is a front end application built using React where signed in users are able to create, edit, and delete events to their planner.

## Planning Process
  My first approach on creating the application consisted of creating the ERD and the Wireframe to have a visualization of the functionalities of the application. From there, I started to work on the API and tested the CRUD actions with curl scripts. While working on the React front end of the application, I started with creating the CRUD actions which would enable the user to create, edit, delete, and view all event(s). Once I finished the CRUD actions, I started creating on the event form that would render the functionalities of the app.

  ## User Stories
   - As a user, I want to be able to sign-up
   - As a user, I want to be able to sign-in
   - As a user, I want to be able to change password
   - As a user, I want to be able to sign-out
   - As a user, I would like success/failure messages when I have completed an auth action.
   - As a user, I would like to create an event
   - As a  user, I would like to view all events
   - As a user, I would like to edit an event
   - As a user, I would like to delete an event
